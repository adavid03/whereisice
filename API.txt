Notes:
- All endpoints are public and support CORS
- No authentication required
- No rate limiting currently implemented

Usage:
- Do not abuse the API, and do not make excessive requests.
- If you are using the API for a project, please credit whereisice.org.
- The API is free and public, including for commercial use.

Note from the developer:
- This API runs on a Next.JS server hosted on a low power machine.
- The API might be easy to overload, so please be considerate.
- Anyone may use the API.
- The API is completely anonymous, no personal identifying information is stored, fetched or used.
- It is not uncommon for the API to temporarily stop working, as it is hosted in Wyoming and the internet can be flaky.
- Rate limiting will eventually be implemented, at least through Cloudflare.
